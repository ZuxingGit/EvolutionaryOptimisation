abstract = {We propose a novel data-driven technique for automatically and efficiently generating floor plans for residential buildings with given boundaries. Central to this method is a two-stage approach that imitates the human design process by locating rooms first and then walls while adapting to the input building boundary. Based on observations of the presence of the living room in almost all floor plans, our designed learning network begins with positioning a living room and continues by iteratively generating other rooms. Then, walls are first determined by an encoder-decoder network, and then they are refined to vector representations using dedicated rules. To effectively train our networks, we construct RPLAN - a manually collected large-scale densely annotated dataset of floor plans from real residential buildings. Intensive experiments, including formative user studies and comparisons, are conducted to illustrate the feasibility and efficacy of our proposed approach. By comparing the plausibility of different floor plans, we have observed that our method substantially outperforms existing methods, and in many cases our floor plans are comparable to human-created ones.},

abstract = {Computer-aided intelligent design can improve the quality and efficiency of residential building design. However, the design conditions are diverse, and numerous combinations of spatial elements exist. We propose a heuristic algorithm—the combined Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (PSO-MCTS)—for the automated design of residential floor layouts. The MCTS algorithm deals with discrete variables (room locations). It considers architectural design experience and design standards during node pruning to compress the search space and simplify the computation. The PSO algorithm deals with continuous variables (room sizes) and accelerates the computing speed due to parallel processing. The PSO-MCTS algorithm achieves a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. It is suitable for various design conditions and requirements. The input parameters include the daylight façade, boundary scope, entrance location, room type and size, and relationships with adjacent rooms. The PSO-MCTS provides 100 %, 80 %, and 75 % better results than heuristic algorithms, designs by architects, and a state-of-the-art deep learning model, respectively.}

abstract = {Satisfying consumers is an important task in the design of residential floor plans. However, the design of residential floor plans with the aim of improving consumer satisfaction and energy performance has not been fully explored. Also, the preferences of different customer groups regarding customer satisfaction have not been studied. Traditional design and optimization methods still have limitations in terms of performance improvement, while performance-based generative design methods can explore the performance improvement potential of a larger range of solution spaces. Therefore, this study introduces a generative design framework that is grounded on optimizing energy performance and consumer satisfaction for multi-unit residential floor plans, which consists of four main processes: 1) Generation of floor plan schemes. 2) Evaluation of consumer satisfaction and energy performance of the generated schemes. 3) Running a multi-objective optimization to obtain optimal schemes. 4) The final floor plan scheme is determined by the decision maker. The proposed framework was employed in a real design case, and seven optimal solutions were obtained. Compared with the initial scheme, the maximum improvement in consumer satisfaction and energy performance was up to 38.78% and 11.18% respectively. The results also indicated that the preferences of different types of consumers differed significantly. Thus, different evaluation functions have been created to provide solutions with higher satisfaction levels targeting different types of consumers. As such, generative design and optimization of residential floor plans for specific types of consumers can be undertaken at an early design stage to improve consumer satisfaction and reduce energy consumption.}

Combining human evaluation with an optimization system for engineering design enables us to embed domain specific knowledge which is frequently hard to describe, subjective criteria and preferences in engineering design. We introduce IGA technique to extend previous approaches with sequential single objective GA and multi-objective GA. We also introduce parallel IGA newly. Experimental results show that (1) the multi-objective IGA and the parallel IGA clearly provide better results than the sequential IGA, and (2) the multi-objective IGA provides more diverse results and faster convergence for a floor planning task although the parallel IGA provides better fitness convergence.",

    abstract = { The article presents the application of Hybrid Evolutionary and Greedy-based algorithms to the problem of Automated Floor Plan Generation. The described optimization issue is part of a wider domain of Computer-Aided Architectural Design. The article covers the extensive description of the representation domain model (architectural canonical guidelines, user design requirements and constraints) and the explanation of proposed approach: problem representation, genetic algorithm operators, and fitness function definition. The research experimental procedures are based on real-world data: the architectural design guidelines being the design constraints and five real-world functional programs introduced and proposed as benchmarks. The article summarizes the implementation of the proposed approach, compares the Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm experimental results with the Greedy-based algorithm, and suggests possible extensions and future research directions. }

abstract = {To identify optimal solutions within a plethora of alternatives with respect to architectural design, multi-objective optimization has been widely acknowledged as a dependable approach. Nevertheless, such optimizations have frequently been conducted as single-objective analyses or have failed to consider both the quantity and uniformity of illumination concurrently with energy consumption as primary objectives. This study posits a proposal consisting of two metrics, one pertaining to the quantity of light and the other to its uniformity. These metrics are derived from the useful daylight illuminance (UDI) and are deemed appropriate for employment in an optimization process. In conjunction with energy consumption, these metrics serve as objectives in a multi-objective optimization that is carried out with a NSGA-II algorithm specifically developed and calibrated for this particular problem. The result of the simulation yields a solution set in three dimensions. The interdependence between the variants and their relationship with each variable were thoroughly examined to facilitate the selection of the optimal solution from the pareto front.}
