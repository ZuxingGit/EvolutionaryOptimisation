Combining human evaluation with an optimization system for engineering design enables us to embed domain specific knowledge which is frequently hard to describe, subjective criteria and preferences in engineering design. We introduce IGA technique to extend previous approaches with sequential single objective GA and multi-objective GA. We also introduce parallel IGA newly. Experimental results show that (1) the multi-objective IGA and the parallel IGA clearly provide better results than the sequential IGA, and (2) the multi-objective IGA provides more diverse results and faster convergence for a floor planning task although the parallel IGA provides better fitness convergence.},

  abstract = {To identify optimal solutions within a plethora of alternatives with respect to architectural design, multi-objective optimization has been widely acknowledged as a dependable approach. Nevertheless, such optimizations have frequently been conducted as single-objective analyses or have failed to consider both the quantity and uniformity of illumination concurrently with energy consumption as primary objectives. This study posits a proposal consisting of two metrics, one pertaining to the quantity of light and the other to its uniformity. These metrics are derived from the useful daylight illuminance (UDI) and are deemed appropriate for employment in an optimization process. In conjunction with energy consumption, these metrics serve as objectives in a multi-objective optimization that is carried out with a NSGA-II algorithm specifically developed and calibrated for this particular problem. The result of the simulation yields a solution set in three dimensions. The interdependence between the variants and their relationship with each variable were thoroughly examined to facilitate the selection of the optimal solution from the pareto front.}

The good approximation performance of neural network (NN) and the effective and robust evolutionary searching ability of genetic algorithm (GA) are applied in hybrid sense, where NNs are employed in predicting the objective value, and GA is adopted in searching optimal designs based on the predicted fitness values.

  abstract = {Satisfying consumers is an important task in the design of residential floor plans. However, the design of residential floor plans with the aim of improving consumer satisfaction and energy performance has not been fully explored. Also, the preferences of different customer groups regarding customer satisfaction have not been studied. Traditional design and optimization methods still have limitations in terms of performance improvement, while performance-based generative design methods can explore the performance improvement potential of a larger range of solution spaces. Therefore, this study introduces a generative design framework that is grounded on optimizing energy performance and consumer satisfaction for multi-unit residential floor plans, which consists of four main processes: 1) Generation of floor plan schemes. 2) Evaluation of consumer satisfaction and energy performance of the generated schemes. 3) Running a multi-objective optimization to obtain optimal schemes. 4) The final floor plan scheme is determined by the decision maker. The proposed framework was employed in a real design case, and seven optimal solutions were obtained. Compared with the initial scheme, the maximum improvement in consumer satisfaction and energy performance was up to 38.78% and 11.18% respectively. The results also indicated that the preferences of different types of consumers differed significantly. Thus, different evaluation functions have been created to provide solutions with higher satisfaction levels targeting different types of consumers. As such, generative design and optimization of residential floor plans for specific types of consumers can be undertaken at an early design stage to improve consumer satisfaction and reduce energy consumption.}

However, the design conditions are diverse, and numerous combinations of spatial elements exist. We propose a heuristic algorithm—the combined Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm (PSO-MCTS)—for the automated design of residential floor layouts. The MCTS algorithm deals with discrete variables (room locations). It considers architectural design experience and design standards during node pruning to compress the search space and simplify the computation. The PSO algorithm deals with continuous variables (room sizes) and accelerates the computing speed due to parallel processing. The PSO-MCTS algorithm achieves a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. It is suitable for various design conditions and requirements. The input parameters include the daylight façade, boundary scope, entrance location, room type and size, and relationships with adjacent rooms. The PSO-MCTS provides 100 %, 80 %, and 75 % better results than heuristic algorithms, designs by architects, and a state-of-the-art deep learning model, respectively.}

  abstract  = {The development of very large-scale integration (VLSI) technology has posed new challenges for electronic design automation (EDA) techniques in chip floorplanning. During this process, macro placement is an important subproblem, which tries to determine the positions of all macros with the aim of minimizing half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) and avoiding overlapping. Previous methods include packing-based, analytical and reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we propose a new black-box optimization (BBO) framework (called WireMask-BBO) for macro placement, by using a wire-mask-guided greedy procedure for objective evaluation. Equipped with different BBO algorithms, WireMask-BBO empirically achieves significant improvements over previous methods, i.e., achieves significantly shorter HPWL by using much less time. Furthermore, it can fine-tune existing placements by treating them as initial solutions, which can bring up to 50\% improvement in HPWL. WireMask-BBO has the potential to significantly improve the quality and efficiency of chip floorplanning, which makes it appealing to researchers and practitioners in EDA and will also promote the application of BBO.

  abstract  = {A memory-based simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm is proposed for the fixed-outline floorplanning with soft blocks. MSA constructs a memory pool to store some historical best solutions. Moreover, it adopts a real-time monitoring strategy to check whether a solution has been trapped in a local optimum. In case a solution encounters this predicament, it will be replaced by the one from the memory pool, and the current temperature will be regenerated by continuously perturbing the new solution several times. To meet the fixed-outline requirements, a new auxiliary function is formulated based on the geometric structure of the current floorplan, and it is very helpful in driving MSA to search towards potential solution space. Concretely, the area information of all violated blocks is utilized to construct an auxiliary function. Moreover, the excessive area of a violated block can be weighted by three different coefficients, which depend on the relative position of the block and the fixed-outline. Additionally, due to its simple topology and strong applicability, B

However, it is extremely difficult to collect data from the space where daily life occurs. Many spatial analysis sensors are required because various daily life data must be collected precisely. Hence, it is difficult for indoor space designers to use the daily-life information of users when managing indoor layouts or floor plans. In this paper, we introduce a technique to solve this problem: simple mobile application (app) logs are used to identify the daily-life patterns of users in an indoor space, and the results are used to create the optimal space layout. We collect and process key information from the mobile app logs and Google app servers to generate a high-dimensional dataset required for user behavior analysis. Subsequently, we suggest a floor plan that minimizes the living cost using a two-dimensional genetic algorithm. Our method will facilitate the spatial analysis of currently inhabited indoor space and reduce the space utilization feedback costs of users.},

               Improving the architectural layout for diverse objectives using rigorous mathematical optimization methods gradually receives more attention by the researchers. Such optimization however, is usually reduced to a much simpler and relatively well-defined problem such as: facility layout optimization, quadratic assignment problem, rectangle partitioning. Nonetheless, architects are usually skeptical about such approaches since they produce solutions which lack certain architectural qualities.
               This paper proposes a framework where architectural functional layout (FL) is optimized for the following objectives: functionality (defined by users), insolation (calculated according to geographical conditions), outside view attractiveness (assessed on-site) and external noise (measured on-site). Incorporating the latter two and simultaneous optimization of FLs for objectives related specifically to the site: position and orientation are the novel contributions of this paper. Firstly, a set of candidate FLs is generated, next they are evaluated for optimal location and orientation on a given site. Optimality is conceived here as maximization of real-valued objective function combining: user’s satisfaction level of the outside views, shielding from external noise, and insolation preference. The importance of these factors for each type of room is assessed by the user (as weights).
               A case study on an existing site is presented. The view quality was arbitrarily assessed and the noise map was assessed by A-weighted equivalent sound level measurements.
               A general gradient-based method for finding optimal and near-optimal solutions was applied. The output of this optimization is a set of room configurations with their locations and orientations on the site returned to the user for final selection.},

               Over the ages, nature has constantly been a rich source of inspiration for science, with much still to discover about and learn from. Swarm Intelligence (SI), a major branch of artificial intelligence, was rendered to model the collective behavior of social swarms in nature. Ultimately, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is arguably one of the most popular SI paradigms. Over the past two decades, PSO has been applied successfully, with good return as well, in a wide variety of fields of science and technology with a wider range of complex optimization problems, thereby occupying a prominent position in the optimization field. However, through in-depth studies, a number of problems with the algorithm have been detected and identified; e.g., issues regarding convergence, diversity, and stability. Consequently, since its birth in the mid-1990s, PSO has witnessed a myriad of enhancements, extensions, and variants in various aspects of the algorithm, specifically after the twentieth century, and the related research has therefore now reached an impressive state. In this paper, a rigorous yet systematic review is presented to organize and summarize the information on the PSO algorithm and the developments and trends of its most basic as well as of some of the very notable implementations that have been introduced recently, bearing in mind the coverage of paradigm, theory, hybridization, parallelization, complex optimization, and the diverse applications of the algorithm, making it more accessible. Ease for researchers to determine which PSO variant is currently best suited or to be invented for a given optimization problem or application. This up-to-date review also highlights the current pressing issues and intriguing open challenges haunting PSO, prompting scholars and researchers to conduct further research both on the theory and application of the algorithm in the forthcoming years.},

It uses a genetic algorithm (GA) for local search on each iteration, because both algorithms have already proven useful for solving similar problems. It adopts a non-slicing structure B* tree for the placement of rectangle modules. B*-trees are based on ordered binary trees. Inheriting from the nice properties of ordered binary trees, B*-trees are very easy for implementation and can perform the respective primitive tree operations, like search, insertion, and deletion in only O(1), O(1) and O(n) times respectively. While existing representations for non-slicing floor-plans need at least O(n) time for each of these operations, where n is the number of modules. GA has been implemented and tested on popular benchmark problems. Experimental results show that GA can quickly produce optimal solutions for all tested benchmark problems.},

  abstract   = {We propose a novel data-driven technique for automatically and efficiently generating floor plans for residential buildings with given boundaries. Central to this method is a two-stage approach that imitates the human design process by locating rooms first and then walls while adapting to the input building boundary. Based on observations of the presence of the living room in almost all floor plans, our designed learning network begins with positioning a living room and continues by iteratively generating other rooms. Then, walls are first determined by an encoder-decoder network, and then they are refined to vector representations using dedicated rules. To effectively train our networks, we construct RPLAN - a manually collected large-scale densely annotated dataset of floor plans from real residential buildings. Intensive experiments, including formative user studies and comparisons, are conducted to illustrate the feasibility and efficacy of our proposed approach. By comparing the plausibility of different floor plans, we have observed that our method substantially outperforms existing methods, and in many cases our floor plans are comparable to human-created ones.},
